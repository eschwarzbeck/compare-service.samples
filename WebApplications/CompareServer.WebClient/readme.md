Configuration
---------------

The Web Client application needs to be installed to a website root. The default location is "Default Web Site". 


### Authentication

The web client uses Windows Authentication. If you use IIS, make sure that *Anonymous authentication* is disabled and *Windows authentication* is enabled.


### Parameters

The sample uses the location of Compare service rendering sets. If the current installation of compare server is not configured with the default location, it must be specified.
In the Web.config, the parameter used for the location of the rendering sets is: *renderset.path*.


```xml
			<appSettings>
				<add key="EndpointConfig" value="CompareWebServiceWCF" />
				<add key="EndpointAddress" value="http://localhost:8080/Comparer/Compare5" />
				<add key="renderset.path" value="C:\ProgramData\Workshare\Compare Service\Rendering Sets" />
				<add key="UploadPath" value="Upload" />
```


### Compare server hosted within IIS

To be able to compare documents using the web client when compare server is deployed as a website, you must edit the Web.config and update the value of EndpointAddress.

**Original web.config:**

```xml
			<appSettings>
				<add key="EndpointConfig" value="CompareWebServiceWCF" />
				<add key="EndpointAddress" value="http://localhost:8080/Comparer/Compare5" />
				<add key="renderset.path" value="C:\ProgramData\Workshare\Compare Service\Rendering Sets" />
				<add key="UploadPath" value="Upload" />
```
				
**Updated web.config:**


```xml
			<appSettings>
				<add key="EndpointConfig" value="CompareWebServiceWCF" />
				<add key="EndpointAddress" value="http://localhost:8080/compareservice.svc/Compare5" />
				<add key="renderset.path" value="C:\ProgramData\Workshare\Compare Service\Rendering Sets" />
				<add key="UploadPath" value="Upload" />
```
